# Branding Workshops - break downs

### Why are we holding these workshops?

The following workshops were held for the ultimate purpose of translating the thoughts discussed into **a name, a slogan, a description of our core offering** - whatever can be used to better encompass what we are. It is the collective opinion that there is great potential for something more meaningful and catchy to be used over the current brand. 

## Workshop 1 - *Purpose and Message*

![Workshop #1 whiteboard][whiteboard1]

### Discussion Points


**What does the company mean?**

Proversity = Professional University

---

**What does the company do?**

Hosts *online professional development programmes* created by companies - namely employers. 

These programmes or "courses" are for a multitude of purposes.

- Primarily the purpose is to gain recognition by companies. "Learners" who take these courses can receive accreditation for successfully completing a course. 
- Another purpose is to disseminate information or learning materials before those Learners enter a programme in real life. 


---

**What will the company do in the future?**

Provide a more holistic learning environment. The same professional content as before as well as:

- Opening up the creation of that professional content to 'experts' in the field who may not not be companies but are proven authorities on subjects - *a new B2C offering*. 
- Curated open-source content which intelligently compliments the professional content
- A searchable library of the world's open source content. 
- Personal profiles which can showcase a user's skills and experience beyond their formal employment and education
- Personal profiles which collect and save all of the user's learning intelligently grouping these into hierarchical collections of knowledge each with a count or score of quantity and type of resources.
- Granting users the right to directly contact experts and employer by the strength of their profiles.
    - "What is the that allows you to connect to employers and experts?"
    - "What is the strength of your connection to those employers and experts in terms of your knowledge set?"

**How do we want to present ourselves?**  

```
Removing barriers to entry for those without "traditional" qualifications or experience

Bridging the gap between employers and learners

Being the key to new opportunities

Speak in easy to understand terms - avoiding "HR" / "Management" speak

Providing "real-time" education resources

Promoting from within the community
```
> Innovation emerges out of groups. The crowd creates the eco-system from which innovation emerges. Naturally the crowd will shine a light on the best. It's not just the best that benefit, however. Because everyone can see the best everyone can learn from the best. They inspire each other to greatness.

*- paraphrased from Chris Anderson's [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/chris_anderson_how_web_video_powers_global_innovation#t-80836)*

### First Round Ideas

##### Names

- > Affinity 


---

##### Messages

- > Connect through content
- > Infinite possibilities to knowledge
- > Explore the infinite possibilities of knowledge
- > Knowledge on demand


---

#### Editor's Notes

The ideas discussed above would lead me to conclude that the emphasis for the brand should be aimed at Learners: the community. Despite the primary sales directive being B2B


## Workshop 2

![Workshop #2 Whiteboard][whiteboard2]

### Discussion Points


**What emotions do we want to convey?**


---


Learners can **demonstrate** their intests and their learning. 

We want to nurture a sense of **excitement** and **pride** at the opportunity to show others what they care about. 
> Bare in mind that this involves breaking down a lot of barriers. For individuals to realise their interests and see value in them 

What's more, the process of curating their learning should be **entertaining** and the very best profiles demand **collaboration** with other learners. 


---

We do not want to encourage a move away from academia. The foundations of knowledge will always be important. However building on that foundation with further education is not always the correct decision. We suspect that **Vocational, 'just in time' learning** is the answer that fits those 

1. for whom further education is not the right option
2. with disabilities for whom further education is not an option
3. for those without the time or resources to invest in expensive professional development.
